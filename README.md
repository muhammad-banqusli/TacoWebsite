# Taco restaurant website

This is a small website built by react js

## Inspiration

The code for this project was inspired by [Dave Gray](https://www.youtube.com/@DaveGrayTeachesCode)'s tutorial on YouTube. The original tutorial was for HTML and CSS, but I adapted it to a React.js project as a learning exercise that might come handy in the future.

## Demo

To see the project in action, you can view the live demo [here](https://taco-website-ebon.vercel.app/).
